          a light day, atypically from Bilbao, I went through the factory to register 
          it with my camera's. I went up and down stairs of elaborate forges, 
          I encountered immense machine halls which looked more like locomotors, 
          the giant rolling pins to knead the dough by hand were still perfectly 
          lined up according to the size. The scale of everything was monumental. 
          Immense oven naves allowed me to reconstruct the situation awaiting 
          the order for someone to move the lever or press the button so that 
          the action would begin and everything began, even the heat could be 
          felt, the motor's noise and the dough's smell.<br>
          <br>
          I went through the spaces where the great kneading boilers rested perfectly 
          aligned up in long rows. Among the different silos in the inside, some 
          were huge as chapels, others like big tents. The cube-shaped artifacts, 
          of mahogany, with white tubular canvases in the inside, were for the 
          breathing in the yeast's fermentation process. Functioned by machines, 
          they seemed to be impossible machines, and so sophisticated that it 
          seemed amazing that they would have had such an elemental functioning 
          at some moment. The manipulation and production premises were perforated 
          and vertically communicated with slides, invisible wells, multicolored 
          tubes which intercrossed and in which each had vertically transported 
          from the sixth floor to the basement, all the different sorts of grain 
          which descended from the silos to the mills. In this process the white 
          powder became a fermented dough to enter the ovens and go out the trucks 
          which awaited the dawn bread to begin their route to the over five hundred 
          sales points, be early and supply the bread before the city wakes.<br>
          <br>
          On the last floor I found a white tiled section, windowed and luminous, 
          empty. It was a strange space which could have belonged to a psychiatric 
          because it only had ten numbered cells with their signs and lined up 
          in pairs which recalled a time-less space out of the place, like sinister 
          vertical containers for people.<br>
          <br>
          In the office wing, found the carved wooden offices, the great boardroom 
          with a monumental wooden table, representing the power of the owners 
          and the assistants to the board of trustees meeting, when founded at 
          the end of the 19th Century, and throughout the whole of the 20th Century. 
          The central space for the office workers was a large wall-less hall, 
          grey and dark, lighted by sinister neons, where one could still breathe 
          its history and the scent of having once been a space filled with activity 
          and order. Given its decadent appearance, it could be observed that 
          nothing had changed since its construction, where all of the administrative 
          employees shared one same space, table against table, elbow against 
          elbow at the large desks for four made of wood and oilcloth. The empty 
          drawers were on the floor, where I found piles of documents, notes, 
          wasted folders filled with documents, a theoretic treatise on flour 
          and bread research from the 30&acute;s, reports, notary papers, letters, 
          each section's small files, the nests each employee kept in his drawer 
          throughout their whole lives, until the final hour of closure came, 
          and they considered it to have no further use.<br>
          <br>
          This employees froze history, held it back, kept what they believed 
          necessary to keep, but which now only had meaning for themselves. The 
          following generations which replaced them throughout the century also 
          kept them with the same consideration and respect, without letting go 
          of them, conscious of the fact that each of them was a part of the factory's 
          history and in some way reflected with the history of the city of Bilbao 
          had been in the 20th Century.</font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#F5F5EA">

        <P class=contenido><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#F5F5EA"> 
          Among the documents abandoned during the office emptying, I found a 
          400 page long document containing a treatise on flour and bread, which, 
          given its out-dated language and the historical period in which it was 
          written, becomes a peculiar and unbelievable curiosity which deserves 
          too be fragmented and rescued. This treatise, typed, is a translation 
          of the Italian treatise written in the 30's under the Duce's rule, by 
          the president of the Italian fascist baker's association. The technicians 
          and engineers used it in our countries in the years after, given the 
          ideological y population similarity of both countries. This theoretical 
          treatise is made up of very extensive chapters on morphology, composition, 
          social study, etc., of the grain, the flour, and lastly, a detailed 
          document on the different processes of bread manufacturing. </font></p>
