        <p class=contenido>After the demolition, a number of previously hidden 
          elements were laid bare, for instance after the fall of the grey wall 
          coating the white silos. Behind a neutral façade there appeared the 
          seven silos, approximately seven storeys high each. These silos were 
          used to store the tonnes of wheat unloaded from train wagons coming 
          from the sunny southern lands. It was video recording the gradual shedding 
          of layers, silo after silo, day after day, until their complete disappearance.</p>

        <p class=contenido>The rate of collapse of these huge metal cylinders 
          was breathtaking. The desolate landscape was enhanced by the cold, the 
          rain, and the noise of the cranes in operation crunching them one by 
          one. With the recording of this hitherto unseen, unique sight, the task 
          of burying an outdated craft came to its end. The artisans were no longer 
          functional, laid aside by new technologies, which arrive in the name 
          of progress and end up invalidating and deleting the production processes 
          and techniques that were in force yesterday and that are now tucked 
          away in the past.
